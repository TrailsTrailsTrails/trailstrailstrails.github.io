    <h3>Day 1: Mt Sonder and the land beyond</h3>

        After being dropped off at Redbank Gorge and setting up camp I climbed Mt Sonder, the beginning (or end) of
        the Larapinta Trail. This section of the trail offers expansive views over the Western MacDonnell Ranges and
        beyond. Mt Zeil, Gosses Bluff and Mt Giles can all be seen from the top.

            Redbank Gorge, Rocky Bar Gap, Hilltop Lookout!
            <br>
            I started the day fairly lazy as it's only 3.5 hours to Rocky Bar Gap. Before I left I ventured into beautiful Redbank Gorge, a detour I'd recommend.
            The hike over to Rocky Bar Gap is easy but doesn't offer outstanding views. On the way I decided to climb to Hilltop Lookout for the night should
            I make it to Rocky Bar Gap in time to do so; I did. I filtered water and pushed hard to get to the top with time to spare before sunset.
            A fantastic spot to camp and highly recommended if you don't mind carrying the extra water.

            Stunning sunrise at Hilltop Lookout! Ancient Finke River!
            <br>
            The day started with a fantastic sunrise and a lazy start. Then I left the rugged Heavitree Range via many switchbacks to
            the plain below. There the trail meanders for a while before it crosses Davenport Creek and Finke River before reaching Finke River Camp.

            Leaving Finke River, Ormiston Lookout and Arriving at Ormiston Gorge!
            <br>
            I left the camp last, around 10am. The trail follows Ormiston Creek, then crosses it and soon leads into undulating hill country.
            Along the way are some nice views with Ormiston Lookout being the highest. It was a windy day which kept temperatures low and the flies away.
            Looking back, Mt Sonder still dominates the landscape.<br>
            After 2.5 hours I reached Ormiston Gorge Camp, its showers, excellent kiosk food, my food drop and many, many birds. Such as an Australian Ringneck;
            some well camouflaged Spinifex Pigeon; a Western Bowerbird with its curious, pink spot.

        <h3>Day 5: Ormiston Gorge & Pound Walk</h3>
        <div class="subtitle">
            Leaving Finke River, Ormiston Lookout and Arriving at Ormiston Gorge!
            <br>
            I started early, long before the sun reached the valley floor, to beat the crowds on this walk. I walked counter
            clockwise which is what I'd recommend in the morning. Icy wind blew down the valley on the way up to the lookout.
            Meanwhile Mt Sonder already basked in the morning sun.<br>
            The view from the lookout is great and one of the best easily accessible views for day walkers. That makes the area
            very popular so beware the crowds if you enjoy solitude. In the afternoon the sandy waterhole in the gorge feels more
            like Bondi Beach than the desert. So just start early, or come late.<br>
            Once I continued into Ormiston gorge its true size slowly became apparent. From now on I just followed the creek as
            there's no defined trail any more. I think this is the overall most massive gorge on the whole LT. The sandy valley
            floor wide, the red cliffs towering overhead, ghost gums clinging to the rock I don't know how.<br>
            Ormiston Gorge is a wonderful place to stay on the LT and I'd recommend it to anyone, no matter if you walk e2e,
            a section or just for the day.

            site (no water, no facilities!).<br>

            Today's hike starts at the fantastic camping spot 1.3km west of Mt Giles Lookout. Mt Giles is visible from the
            ridge. There's Telstra reception at the lookout. The trail then descents and via an untracked creek reaches
            Waterfall Gorge and the camp beyond (no water or toilet). Then follows a long valley which leads over a pass and
            past a gorge to Inarlanga Pass. Finally the trail heads through underlating hills to Serpentine Charlet Dam camp
            site (shelter, water, toilet).

            Did I go for a swim in Ellery Big Hole? Absolutely. But only for a sew seconds as the water is painfully cold.
            I doubt one would survive to tray and swim across.<br>
            Today starts at Ellery Creek. After a few km the trail crosses the Heavitree range a last time and heads out into the wide Alice Valley
            before it reaches Rocky Gully which has water and a toilet.<br>
            Rocky Gully isn't the nicest camping spot; it's dusty and not very scenic but when I got there at 4pm I
            was exhausted from the heat and happy to call it a day. The heat of the day radiated into the night and I
            did a bit of star gazing. Nothing beets the outback sky at night!

            Rocky Gully (24km | 15mi, medium).
            The next day I'd hike into Hugh Gorge to Hugh Junction, a truly impressive camping spot. Get water at Hugh

            Climbing Brinkley Bluff, an afternoon at the summit and camping at maybe the best spot on the whole Larapinta Trail!

            It had gotten windy over night which was a concern considering that I wanted to camp at the exposed summit of Brinkley
            Bluff. Especially on the first climb that became quite apparent. The second section of climbing was truly amazing.
            The excellent trail work did not diminish the sheer awesomeness of this land.<br>
            There's good 4G reception with Telstra at the top. I spent an lovely afternoon up here and enjoyed the sunset. Is it
            worth carrying the extra water up here? I let you be the judge...
